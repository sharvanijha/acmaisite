        <p>Indus is UCLA's political South Asian organization. Our mission is to okay we can paraphrase the mission statement here, if we want. Indus connects with the UCLA community and beyond through its two flagship events, Deepavali and the Zero Week Mixer, as well as other collaborative as well as introspective events held throughout the year. Here is a link to our constitution (maybe we can put this somewhere more convenient / obvious?). <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, <u>underlined</u>, <s>strikethrough</s>. Cats are cute.</p>
